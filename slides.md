# Common Injuries & Prevention

---

# 🖐️ Repetitive Stress Injuries (RSIs)

These happen from doing the same movement over and over—like typing or using a mouse for hours.

## Examples

- Carpal tunnel syndrome, wrist strain, tendonitis.

## Prevention

- Use a proper ergonomic setup (chair, keyboard, mouse, screen height).
- Keep wrists straight and elbows at a 90° angle.
- Take a 5-10 minute break every hour to stretch or move around.
- Do hand/wrist stretches regularly.

---

# 🖐️ Repetitive Stress Injuries (RSIs)

These happen from doing the same movement over and over—like typing or using a mouse for hours.

## First Aid:

- Stop typing and rest the area.
- Apply a cold compress if there’s swelling.
- Use a wrist brace for support.
- If pain continues, see a doctor.

---

# 👀 Eyestrain (a.k.a. Computer Vision Syndrome)

Caused by looking at screens for too long without a break.

## Prevention

- Follow the 20-20-20 Rule: Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.
- Adjust screen brightness and text size.
- Use blue light filters or “night mode” in the evening.
- Make sure lighting in the room is comfortable (avoid glare).

---

# 👀 Eyestrain (a.k.a. Computer Vision Syndrome)

Caused by looking at screens for too long without a break.

## First Aid

- Look away from the screen and rest your eyes.
- Blink often or use eye drops if they feel dry.
- Close your eyes for a few minutes to relax them.

---

# 🪑 Back, Neck, and Shoulder Pain

Sitting for long periods in a bad posture can cause soreness.

## Prevention

- Sit upright with feet flat on the floor.
- Keep your monitor at eye level.
- Get up to stretch and walk around every hour.

## First Aid

- Apply heat to relax muscles or ice for swelling.
- Gentle stretching or massage may help.
- Adjust your workspace ergonomics.

---

# 🧃 Hydration and Fatigue

Sitting and staring at a screen can make you forget to drink water or rest your body and brain.

## Prevention

- Keep a water bottle nearby.
- Take short breaks to move and reset your focus.

## First Aid

- Hydrate if you feel tired or dizzy.
- Take a mental break or nap if overly fatigued.

# 🧮 1800s - The First "Program"

Ada Lovelace, a British mathematician, wrote the first algorithm meant for a machine (Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine).

She imagined a machine that could follow instructions—before computers even existed!

# 💻 1950s – Programming Languages Are Born

The first real programming languages were created:

- Assembly language (machine-level instructions)
- Fortran (1957) – short for “Formula Translation”, used for science & math

This is when programming started to look more like math or code rather than wires.

# Python
print("Hello, World!")
```

```csharp
// C#
using System;
namespace MyProgram
class Program {
    void static main(string[] args) {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}

# Variables

## Store data for use in your program

```python
// Python
name = "Alex"
age = 15
```

```csharp
// C#
string name = "Alex";
int age = 15;
```

```javascript
// Javascript
let name = "Alex";
const age = 15;
var val = "Test";
```

---

# Data Types

| Type       | Python  | C#       | JavaScript |
| ---------- | ------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Number     | `int`   | `int`    | `number`   |
| Decimal    | `float` | `double` | `number`   |
| True/False | `bool`  | `bool`   | `boolean`  |
| Text       | `str`   | `string` | `string`   |

---

# Conditionals

- Make decisions in code
- Use `if`, `else if`, and `else` to handle different paths

```python
# Python
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
elif age >= 13:
    print("Teenager")
else:
    print("Child")
```

---

# Conditionals

- Make decisions in code
- Use `if`, `else if`, and `else` to handle different paths

```csharp
// C#
if (age >= 18) {
    Console.WriteLine("Adult");
} else if (age >= 13) {
    Console.WriteLine("Teenager");
} else {
    Console.WriteLine("Child");
}
```

---

# Conditionals

- Make decisions in code
- Use `if`, `else if`, and `else` to handle different paths

```javascript
// Javascript
if (age >= 18) {
    console.log("Adult");
} else if (age >= 13) {
    console.log("Teenager");
} else {
    console.log("Child");
}
```

---

# Loops

- Repeat actions

```python
# Python
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```

```csharp
// C#
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    Console.WriteLine(i);
}
```

```javascript
// Javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
```

---

# Functions

- Reusable blocks of code

```python
# Python
def greet(name):
    print("Hi, " + name)
```

```csharp
// C#
void Greet(string name) {
    Console.WriteLine("Hi, " + name);
}
```

```javascript
// Javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hi, " + name);
}
```

---

# Arrays & Lists

- Store multiple values

```python
## Python
colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]
```

```csharp
// C#
string[] colors = [ "red", "blue", "green" ];
```

```javascript
// Javascript
let colors = ["red", "blue", "green"];
```

---

# Arrays & List Operations

- Get information about the array or list

```python
## Python
colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]
print(len(colors))  # Output: 3
```

```csharp
// C#
string[] colors = { "red", "blue", "green" };
Console.WriteLine(colors.Length);  // Output: 3
```

```javascript
// Javascript
let colors = ["red", "blue", "green"];
console.log(colors.length);  // Output: 3
```

---

# For Each Loops

- Repeat actions against a list or array

```python
# Python
colors = ["red", "blue", "green"]
for color in colors:
    print(color)
```

```csharp
// C#
string[] colors = { "red", "blue", "green" };
foreach (string color in colors) {
    Console.WriteLine(color);
}
```

---

# For Each Loops

- Repeat actions against a list or array

```javascript
// Javascript
let colors = ["red", "blue", "green"];
for (let color of colors) {
    console.log(color);
}
```

---

# Functions

- Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
- They help make your code modular and easier to read.

```python
# Python
def greet(name):
    print("Hi, " + name)

# Call the function
greet("Alex")
```

```csharp
// C#
void Greet(string name) {
    Console.WriteLine("Hi, " + name);
}

// Call the function
Greet("Alex");
```

```javascript
// JavaScript
function greet(name) {
    console.log("Hi, " + name);
}

// Call the function
greet("Alex");
```
